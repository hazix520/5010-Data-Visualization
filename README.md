5010 Data Visualization

link(https://editor.p5js.org/Hazix/sketches/NyZUiHpwV)

My main goal was to get comfortable parsing throughh data from a JSON file. From the link provided I found a JSON file with the Pokemon Go Gen 1 Pokedex and I decided to try to read and display some of that data like it would in the game. I limited the number of pokemon to the first 9 (all of the starters) because the way I made the code it would render all 151 at the same time. It would take a lot more time to only show the ones that are currently on screen. I also made it so you can scroll through depending on your mouse placement. Each pokemon displays their name, image, dexNo and type.
